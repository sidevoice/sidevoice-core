//! Types for the ElevenLabs Voice endpoints.
//!
//! Covers voice management operations including:
//! - `GET /v1/voices` — list all voices
//! - `GET /v1/voices/{voice_id}` — get a single voice
//! - `POST /v1/voices/add` — add a new voice (multipart)
//! - `POST /v1/voices/{voice_id}/edit` — edit a voice (multipart)
//! - `DELETE /v1/voices/{voice_id}` — delete a voice
//! - `GET /v1/voices/{voice_id}/settings` — get voice settings
//! - `POST /v1/voices/{voice_id}/settings/edit` — edit voice settings
//! - `GET /v1/voices/{voice_id}/samples/{sample_id}/audio` — get sample audio
//! - `DELETE /v1/voices/{voice_id}/samples/{sample_id}` — delete a sample
//!
//! Related sub-resources (samples, fine-tuning, sharing, verification) are
//! included as embedded response types.
